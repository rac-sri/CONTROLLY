## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the latest tragedy of the boys' locker room that happened in India. There was the spread of this information about a boys-only group in which the participants were body-shaming and planning hideous crimes like rape. There were two separate cases, one on Instagram and on Snapchat. The police proved that the Snapchat case was fake. But before even anything was proven, people started to spread hate speeches against the parties involved. This eventually resulted in one of the involved party to commit suicide.

## What it does

My solution aims to notify people if the text or message they are gonna put on their stories or send to someone, might cause someone a mental breakdown. This bot basically is aimed at people who are unable to analyze if the message they are sending will affect someone mentally or not and that they are not unknowingly leading someone towards a state of depression, anxiety, etc.
The bot awards the person coming to it with a potential hatred speech with an NFT token. The texts are recorded on the blockchain. The reward is claimed whenever someone gives any new potentially dangerous hatred text to the bot. This way people also get attracted to using the chatbot since they are being rewarded for it.
